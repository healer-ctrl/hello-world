In this case, the vacuum job ran successfully and completed in approximately 20 minutes. The CANS server was manually started by the support team at 11:11 PM IST / 6:41 PM CET on Saturday, which was about 2 hours after the vacuum job completed. Therefore, no operational impact was caused by the early server start.

However, multiple alerts were triggered the next day when Autosys attempted to start jobs and detected that CANS was already running. Once the job statuses were manually set to “Success,” the alerts stopped — which is expected behavior.
